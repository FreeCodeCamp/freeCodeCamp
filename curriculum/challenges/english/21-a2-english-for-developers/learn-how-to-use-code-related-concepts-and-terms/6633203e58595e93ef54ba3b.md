Which sentence uses `what` correctly?

## --distractors--

`She knows what does he like.`

This is incorrect. The correct structure should be `She knows what he likes`, without the auxiliary verb `does` in the clause.

---

`What she is watching is very interesting?`

### --feedback--

This sentence incorrectly ends with a question mark as it is not a question but a statement.

---

`Tell me what is your name.`

### --feedback--

This is incorrect. The correct question form is `What is your name?` or `Tell me what your name is.`

## --answer--

`I don't understand what you mean.`
