---

Using the `object` keyword.

#### --distractors--

---

The function itself.

---

An undefined reference.

#### --answer--

The specific instance of the class being created.

### --question--

#### --text--

#### --distractors--

It refers to the method calling the arrow function.

---

It refers to a newly created instance of the class.

---

It refers to `undefined` by default.

#### --answer--

It captures the `this` value from the lexical scope, typically the class instance.

### --question--

#### --text--

#### --distractors--

To define static methods in a class.

---

To create a method in a class.

---

To initialize properties in the parent class.

#### --answer--

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the output of the following code?

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() { return "Animal speaks"; }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() { return "Dog barks"; }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
console.log(myDog.speak());
```

#### --distractors--

`Animal speaks`

---

An error is raised.

---

`undefined`

#### --answer--

`Dog barks`

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the function of the `super` keyword in a subclass?

#### --distractors--

To define a new instance of a class.

---

To delete properties from a class.

---

To access only the static methods of a class.

#### --answer--

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following describes a static method?

#### --distractors--

A method that cannot be accessed inside the class itself.

---

A method that is used only in arrow functions.

---

A method that is unique to each instance of a class.

#### --answer--

A method that belongs to the class itself, not to any instance.

### --question--

#### --text--

What will the following code output?

```javascript
class Calculator {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(Calculator.add(3, 4));
```

#### --distractors--

An error is raised.

---

`undefined`

---

`NaN`

#### --answer--

`7`

### --question--

#### --text--

How would you access a static property in JavaScript?

#### --distractors--

Using `this.propertyName` within a method.

---

Using `instance.propertyName` after creating an instance.

---

Using `super.propertyName` within a subclass.

#### --answer--

Using `ClassName.propertyName`.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which statement is true about `this` in JavaScript classes?

#### --distractors--

It always refers to the global context.

---

It changes based on the scope within each method.

---

It has the same behavior in both arrow functions and regular functions.

#### --answer--

In regular functions within a class, `this` refers to the instance, while in arrow functions, `this` is lexically scoped.

### --question--

#### --distractors--

It throws an error only in strict mode.

---
