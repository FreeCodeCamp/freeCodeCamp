# --description--

Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

- Recursion is programming concept that allows you to call a function repeatedly until a base-case is reached. 
- Recursion allows you to handle something with an unknown depth, such as deeply nested objects/arrays, or a file tree. 
- You should carefully define the base case as calling it indefinitely can cause your code to crash. This is because the recursion keeps piling more and more function calls till the system runs out of memory.
- Recursions find their uses in solving mathematical problems like factorial and Fibonacci, traversing trees and graphs, generating permutations and combinations and much more.
