# --description--

Watch the video lecture and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What modifier should be added to a regular expression to match all occurrences of a pattern in a string?

## --distractors--

`/i`

### --feedback--

The lecture mentions a specific modifier for global matching.

---

`/m`

### --feedback--

The lecture mentions a specific modifier for global matching.

---

`/a`

### --feedback--

The lecture mentions a specific modifier for global matching.

## --answer--

`/g`

## --text--

What is the main difference between `match()` and `matchAll()` methods when used with a global regular expression?

## --distractors--

`matchAll()` is faster than `match()`.

### --feedback--

The lecture describes a special type of object returned by `matchAll()`.

---

`match()` can only find the first occurrence, while `matchAll()` finds all occurrences.

### --feedback--

The lecture describes a special type of object returned by `matchAll()`.

---

There is no difference, they are interchangeable

### --feedback--

The lecture describes a special type of object returned by `matchAll()`.

## --answer--

`match()` returns an array, while `matchAll()` returns an Iterator.

## --text--

How can you convert the result of `matchAll()` into an array containing all matches?

## --distractors--

By using a `for...of` loop

### --feedback--

The lecture demonstrates a specific method to convert the `Iterator` to an array.

---

By calling the `toArray()` method on the result.

### --feedback--

The lecture demonstrates a specific method to convert the `Iterator` to an array.

---

By spreading the result into an array literal.

### --feedback--

The lecture demonstrates a specific method to convert the Iterator to an array.

## --answer--

By using `Array.from()` with the result as an argument.
