Watch the video lecture and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What would the following code output?

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/i;
console.log(regex.test("I love FREECODECAMP!"));
console.log(regex.test("freeCodoCamp"));
console.log(regex.test("We went freeCodeCamping."));
```

## --distractors--

```js
true
true
true
```

### --feedback--

The `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive, so `freeCodeCamp` matches regardless of case, as long as the letters are the same.

---

```js
true
false
true
```

### --feedback--

The `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive, so `freeCodeCamp` matches regardless of case, as long as the letters are the same.

---

```js
false
false
false
```

## --answer--

```js
true
true
false
```

## --text--

When would you NOT want to use the global (`g`) flag in a regular expression?

## --distractors--

When you want to match a pattern multiple times within a single string.

### --feedback--

The `g` flag is stateful, meaning it tracks the last match, which can cause issues when testing multiple strings.

---

When you want the match to start fresh with each new test.

### --feedback--

The `g` flag is stateful, meaning it tracks the last match, which can cause issues when testing multiple strings.

---

When you want to make the regex case-insensitive.

### --feedback--

The `g` flag is stateful, meaning it tracks the last match, which can cause issues when testing multiple strings.

## --answer--

When you are testing multiple strings and don't need to track match state.

## --text--

What does the multi-line (`m`) modifier do in a regular expression?

## --distractors--

It makes the regular expression case-insensitive.

### --feedback--

The `m` modifier enables matching at the start and end of lines in multi-line strings.

---

It allows the regular expression to match linebreaks.

### --feedback--

The `m` modifier enables matching at the start and end of lines in multi-line strings.

---

It makes the regular expression match globally.

### --feedback--

The `m` modifier enables matching at the start and end of lines in multi-line strings.

## --answer--

It allows anchors (`^` and `$`) to match the start and end of each line, not just the entire string.
