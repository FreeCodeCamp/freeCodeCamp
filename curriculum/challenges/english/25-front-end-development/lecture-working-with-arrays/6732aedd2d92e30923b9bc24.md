```

## --distractors--

`1 2 [3, 4, 5]`

let [primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary = 'yellow'] = colors;
console.log(quaternary);
```

let [first, ...rest, last] = fruits;
console.log(first, rest, last);
```

## --distractors--

`'apple' ['banana', 'orange'] 'grape'`

### --feedback--

Consider the placement of the rest syntax in the destructuring assignment and think about whether this is a valid use of the rest syntax.

---

`'apple' ['banana', 'orange', 'grape'] undefined`

### --feedback--

Consider the placement of the rest syntax in the destructuring assignment and think about whether this is a valid use of the rest syntax.
