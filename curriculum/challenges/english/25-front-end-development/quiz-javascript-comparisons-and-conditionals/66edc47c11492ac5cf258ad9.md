### --question--

#### --text--

What's the difference between `==` and `===`?

#### --distractors--

There is no difference, both have the exact same function.

Both operators check the data type of the value, but only `===` compares values deeply.

#### --answer--

`===` compares the value and type without type coercion, while `==` attempts to convert them to the same type before comparing.
