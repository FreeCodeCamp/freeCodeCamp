Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

## HTML Basics

- **Role of HTML**: HTML represents the content and structure of the web page. 
- **HTML Elements**: Used to represent content on the page. Most of them are made by an opening(`<h1>`) and a closing tag(`</h1>`).

```html
<h1>This is a heading element.</h1>
```

- **Void Elements**: Do not have a closing tag (e.g., `<img>`). Void elements cannot have any content and only have a start tag. I
- **Attributes**: An attribute is a value placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave. Here is the basic syntax for an attribute:

```html
<element attribute="value"></element>
```

A boolean attribute is an attribute that can either be present or absent in an HTML tag. If present, the value is true otherwise it is false. Examples of boolean attributes include `disabled`, `readonly`, and `required`. 

- **Comments**: Comments are used in programming to leave notes for yourself and other developers in your code. Here is the syntax for a comment in HTML:

```html
<!--This is an HTML comment.-->
```

## Common HTML elements

- **Heading Elements**: There are six heading elements in HTML. The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements.

```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```

- **Paragraph Elements**: This is used for paragraphs on a web page.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
```

- **`img` Elements**: The `img` element is used to add images to the web page. The src attribute is used to specify the location for that image. For image elements, it's good practice to include another attribute called the alt attribute. Here's an example of an `img` element with the `src` and `alt` attributes:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
```

- **`body` Element**: This element is used to represent the content for the HTML document.

```html
<body>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
</body>    
```

- **`section` Elements**: The section element is used to divide up content into smaller sections.

```html
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I am Jane Doe and I am a web developer.</p>
</section>
```

- **`div` Elements**: The `div` element is a generic HTML element that does not hold any semantic meaning. It is used as a generic container to hold over HTML elements.

```html
<div>
  <h1>I am a heading</h1>
  <p>I am a paragraph</p>
</div>
```

- **Anchor(`a`) Elements**: These elements are used to apply links on a web page. The `href` attribute is used to specify where the link should go when the user clicks on it.

```html
<a href="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg">cute cats</a>
```

- **Unordered(`ul`) and Ordered(`ol`) List Elements**: To create a bulleted list of items you should use the `ul` element with one or more `li` elements nested inside like this:

```html
<ul>
  <li>cat nip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
```

To create an ordered list of items you should use the `ol` element:

```html
<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
```

- **The Emphasis(`em`) Element**: This is used to place emphasis on a piece of text. 

```html
<p>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</p>  
```

- **The Strong Importance(`strong`) Element**: This element is used to place strong emphasis on text to indicate a sense of urgency and seriousness. 

```html
<p>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Before proceeding, make sure to wear your safety goggles. 
</p>
```

- **`figure` and `figcaption` Elements**: The `figure` element is used to group content like images and diagrams. The `figcaption` element is used to represent a caption for that content inside the `figure` element.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Five cats looking around a field.">
  <figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>  
</figure>
```

- **`main` Element**: This element is used to represent the main content for a web page.
- **`footer` Element**: This element is placed at the bottom of hte HTML document and usually contains copyright information and other important page links.

```html
<footer>
  <p>
    No Copyright - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
  </p>
</footer>
```

## Identifiers and Grouping

- **IDs**: Unique element identifiers for HTML elements. ID names should only be used once per HTML document. 

```html
<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
```

ID names cannot have spaces. If you ID name contains multiple words then you can use dashes to between the words like this:

```html
<div id="red-box"></div>
```

- **Classes**: Classes are used to group elements for styling and behavior. 

```html
<div class="box"></div>
```

Unlike IDs, you can reuse the same class name throughout the HTML document. The `class` value can also have spaces like this:

```html
<div class="box red-box"></div>
<div class="box blue-box"></div>
```

## Special Characters and Linking

- **HTML entities**: Using special characters like `&amp;` and `&lt;`.
- **`link` Element**: The `link` element is used to link to external resources like stylesheets and site icons. Here is the basic syntax for using the link element for an external CSS file. The `rel` attribute is used to specify the relationship between the linked resource and the HTML document. The `href` attribute is used to specify the location of the URL for the external resource.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
```

- **`script` Element**: The `script` element is used to embed executable code.

```html
<body>
  <script>
    alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
  </script>
</body>
```

While you can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the script tags, it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead. Here is an example of using the script element to link to an external JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
```

The `src` attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file.

## Boilerplate and Encoding

- **HTML boilerplate**: This is a boilerplate that includes the basic structure and essential elements every HTML document needs.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>freeCodeCamp</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--Headings, paragraphs, images, etc. go inside here-->
  </body>
</html>
```

- **`DOCTYPE`**: This is used to tell browsers which version of HTML you're using.
- **`html` Element**: This represents the top level element or the root of an HTML document. To specify the language for the document, you should use the `lang` attribute.
- **`head` Element**: The `head` section contains important meta data which is behind-the-scenes information needed for browsers and search engines.
- **`meta` Elements**: These elements represent your site's metadata. These element have details about things like character encoding, and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link and more.
- **`title` Element**: This element is used to set the text that appears in the browser tab or window.
- **UTF-8 character encoding**: UTF-8, or UCS Transformation Format 8, is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web. Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data. The `charset` attribute is used inside of a `meta` element to set the character encoding to UTF-8.

## SEO and Social Sharing

- **SEO**: Search Engine Optimization is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible and rank higher on search engines.  
- **Meta tags (`description`)**: This is used to provide a short description for the web page and impacting SEO.

```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>
```

- **Open Graph tags**: Enhancing social media sharing.

## Media Elements and Optimization

- **Replaced elements**: Embedded content (e.g., images, iframes).
- **Optimizing media**: Techniques to improve media performance.
- **Image formats and licenses**: Understanding usage rights and types.
- **SVGs**: Scalable vector graphics for sharp visuals.

## Multimedia Integration

- **HTML audio and video elements**: Embedding multimedia.
- **Embedding with `<iframe>`**: Integrating external video content.

## Paths and Link Behavior

- **Target attribute types**: Controlling link behavior.
- **Absolute vs. relative paths**: Navigating directories.
- **Path syntax**: Understanding `/`, `./`, `../` for file navigation.
- **Link states**: Managing different link interactions (hover, active).
