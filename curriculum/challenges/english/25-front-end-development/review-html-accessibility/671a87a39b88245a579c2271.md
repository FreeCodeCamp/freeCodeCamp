Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

## Introduction to Accessibility

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The four principles of WCAG are POUR which stands for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

## Assistive Technology for Accessibility

- **Screen readers**: Screen readers are software programs that read the content of a computer screen out loud. They are used by people who are blind or visually impaired to access the web.
- **Large text or braille keyboards**: Large text or braille keyboards are used by people with visual impairments to access the web.
- **Screen magnifiers**: Screen magnifiers are software programs that enlarge the content of a computer screen. They are used by people with low vision to access the web.
- **Alternative pointing devices**: Alternative pointing devices are used by people with mobility impairments to access the web. This includes devices such as joysticks, trackballs, and touchpads.
- **Screen magnifiers**: Screen magnifiers are software programs that enlarge the content of a computer screen. They are used by people with low vision to access the web.
- **Voice recognition**: Voice recognition software is used by people with mobility impairments to access the web. It allows users to control a computer using their voice.

## Accessibility Auditing Tools

- **Google Lighthouse**: Google Lighthouse is an open-source tool that can be used to audit the accessibility of a website. It provides a report with recommendations for improving accessibility.
- **Wave**: Wave is a web accessibility evaluation tool that can be used to audit the accessibility of a website. It provides a report with recommendations for improving accessibility.
- **IBM Equal Accessibility Checker**: IBM Equal Accessibility Checker is a web accessibility evaluation tool that can be used to audit the accessibility of a website. It provides a report with recommendations for improving accessibility.

## Accessibility Best Practices

- **Proper heading level structure**: You should use proper heading levels to create a logical structure for your content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of your website.
- **Accessibility and Tables**: When using tables, you should use the `<th>` element to define header cells and the `<td>` element to define data cells. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure of the table.
- **Importance for inputs to have an associated label**: You should use the `<label>` element to associate labels with form inputs. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the purpose of the input.
- **Importance of good `alt` text**: You should use the `alt` attribute to provide a text alternative for images. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of the image.
- **Importance of good link text**: You should use descriptive link text to help users understand the purpose of the link. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of the link.
- **Best practices for making audio and video content accessible**: You should provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content to make it accessible to people with hearing impairments. You should also provide audio descriptions for video content to make it accessible to people with visual impairments.
- **`tabindex` attribute**: The `tabindex` attribute can be used to specify the order in which elements should receive focus when using the tab key to navigate the website. This can help users with mobility impairments navigate the website more easily.
- **`accesskey` attribute**: The `accesskey` attribute can be used to define a keyboard shortcut for an element. This can help users with mobility impairments navigate the website more easily.

## WAI-ARIA, Roles, and Attributes

- **WAI-ARIA**: WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility. It provides additional information to assistive technologies about the purpose and structure of the content.
- **Aria roles**: Aria roles are a set of predefined roles that can be added to HTML elements to define their purpose. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of the website. Examples include `role="button"`, `role="dialog"`, and `role="navigation"`.
- **`aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` attributes**: The `aria-label` attribute can be used to provide a text alternative for an element. The `aria-labelledby` attribute can be used to associate an element with another element that serves as its label. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the purpose of the element.
- **`aria-hidden` attribute**: The `aria-hidden` attribute can be used to hide an element from screen readers. This can be useful for decorative elements that do not provide any meaningful content.
- **`aria-expanded` attribute**: The `aria-expanded` attribute can be used to indicate whether an element is expanded or collapsed. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the state of the element.
- **`aria-live` attribute**: The `aria-live` attribute can be used to indicate that an element's content is live and should be announced by screen readers. This is useful for elements that are updated dynamically.
- **Common Aria states**: Common Aria states include `aria-haspopup`, `aria-checked`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-selected`. These attributes can be used to indicate the state of an element and help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of the website.
- **`aria-controls` attribute**: The `aria-controls` attribute can be used to associate an element with another element that it controls. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the relationship between the elements.
- **`aria-describedby` attribute**: The `aria-describedby` attribute can be used to associate an element with another element that describes it. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the purpose of the element.
