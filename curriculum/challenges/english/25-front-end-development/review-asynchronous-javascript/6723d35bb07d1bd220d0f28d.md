# --description--

Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

- **Synchronous JavaScript** is executed sequentially and waits for the previous operation to finish before moving on to the next one.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** allows multiple operations to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread.
- **Thread** is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of the main program flow.
- **Callback functions** are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of the operation or as a result of an event.
- **Promises** are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. The value of the promise is known only when the async operation is completed.

## The `async` attribute

- The `async` attribute tells the browser to download the script file asynchronously while continuing to parse the HTML document. 
- Once the script is downloaded, the HTML parsing is paused, the script is executed, and then HTML parsing resumes.
- You should use `async` for independent scripts where the order of execution doesn't matter

## The `defer` attribute

- The `defer` attribute also downloads the script asynchronously, but it defers the execution of the script until after the HTML document has been fully parsed. 
- The `defer` scripts maintain the order of execution as they appear in the HTML document.

- It's important to note that both `async` and `defer` attributes are ignored for inline scripts and only work for external script files.

- When both `async` and `defer` attributes are present, the `async` attribute takes precedence.
