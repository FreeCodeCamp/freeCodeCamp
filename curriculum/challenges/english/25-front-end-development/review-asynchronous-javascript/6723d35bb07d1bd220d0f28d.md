# --description--

Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

- **Synchronous JavaScript** is executed sequentially and waits for the previous operation to finish before moving on to the next one.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** allows multiple operations to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread.
- **Thread** is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of the main program flow.
- **Callback functions** are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of the operation or as a result of an event.
- **Promises** are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. The value of the promise is known only when the async operation is completed.

## The JavaScript engine and JavaScript runtime

- The **JavaScript engine** is a program that executes JavaScript code in a web browser. It works like a converter that takes your code, turns it into instructions that the computer can understand and work accordingly. 
- The JavaScript engine first parses your code, reading it line by line to make sure there are no mistakes in the JavaScript code. Then, it converts this code into bytecode, which is a simpler, intermediate version of your code thatâ€™s easier for the computer to understand and execute. Finally, it runs this bytecode to execute your program's instructions.
- V8 is an example of a JavaScript engine developed by Google.
- The **JavaScript runtime** is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It includes the JavaScript engine which processes and executes the code, and additional features like a web browser or Node.js.

## The fetch API

- The `fetch` API allows web apps to make network requests, typically to retrieve or send data to the server. This API provides a `fetch()` method that you can use to make these requests.
- You can retrieve text, images, JSON, and other types of data using the `fetch` API.

## HTTP methods for fetch API

The `fetch` API supports various HTTP methods to interact with the server. The most common methods are:

- **GET**: Used to retrieve data from the server. By default, the `fetch` API uses the `GET` method to retrieve data.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
```

To use the fetched data, it must be converted to JSON format using the `.json()` method:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

In this code, the response coming from the fetch API is a promiseand the `.then` handler is converting the response to a JSON format.

- **POST**: Used to send data to the server. The `POST` method is used to create new resources on the server.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  })
})
```

In this example, we're sending a `POST` request to create a new user. We have specified the method as `POST`, set the appropriate headers, and included a body with the data we want to send. The body needs to be a string, so we use `JSON.stringify()` to convert our object to a JSON string.

- **PUT**: Used to update data on the server. The `PUT` method is used to update existing resources on the server.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/45', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Smith',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  })
})
```

In this example, we are updating the ID `45` that is specified at the end of the URL. We have used the `PUT` method on the code and also specified the data as the body which will be used to update the identified data. 

- **DELETE**: Used to delete data on the server. The `DELETE` method is used to delete resources on the server.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/45', {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
```

In this example, we're sending a `DELETE` request to remove a user with the ID `45`.

## Promise chaining

## async/await and how does it work?

## The `async` attribute

- The `async` attribute tells the browser to download the script file asynchronously while continuing to parse the HTML document. 
- Once the script is downloaded, the HTML parsing is paused, the script is executed, and then HTML parsing resumes.
- You should use `async` for independent scripts where the order of execution doesn't matter

## The `defer` attribute

- The `defer` attribute also downloads the script asynchronously, but it defers the execution of the script until after the HTML document has been fully parsed. 
- The `defer` scripts maintain the order of execution as they appear in the HTML document.

- It's important to note that both `async` and `defer` attributes are ignored for inline scripts and only work for external script files.

- When both `async` and `defer` attributes are present, the `async` attribute takes precedence.
