The "scale" of something refers to its size. 

When you're looking at scaling in your web design, you're looking at the size relationships between different elements, and how these elements might adapt to different screen sizes.

Using the correct scale for your elements plays an important role in visual hierarchy. Larger elements will draw more attention, which can guide your users through the content in the way that you want.

The visual separation draws your reader’s attention, but the scale isn't ideal. If you increase that scale, you get a more eye-catching text that pulls your reader to that section.

Scale doesn't apply just to text, though. It's also important for images. Consider the layout with a new banner image.

The scale of this banner image might make sense for a desktop layout. It's eye-catching, but you can still see the information you need.

On a mobile layout, however, this scale might be too large.

The image now takes up over half of the screen! By scaling the image down to a more appropriate ratio, you can keep the visual impact while ensuring the information on the site is visible.

Scale is also important for interactivity, and the ability to actually use your website. Take a look at the navigation bar on mobile.

The text in the navigation bar is not at an appropriate scale – it's too small! Mobile phone users will have a hard time tapping on the links. 

And if you scale it appropriately, you end up with links that are not only easier to read, but easier to click on for your mobile users.

There are many ways that scale is important in your designs. We've covered the basics, so you should now have a fundamental understanding of its importance.
