# --description--

Watch the video lecture and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the primary difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?

## --distractors--

Synchronous code is more efficient than asynchronous code.

### --feedback--

Think about how the execution flow differs between the two.

---

Synchronous code is only used for simple tasks, while asynchronous code is used for complex tasks.

### --feedback--

Think about how the execution flow differs between the two.

---

Synchronous code is always faster than asynchronous code.

### --feedback--
