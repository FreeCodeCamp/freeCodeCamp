    <h2>What is HTML and what role does it play on the web?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for creating web pages. When you visit a website and see content like paragraphs, headings, links, images, and videos, that's HTML. HTML represents the content and structure of a web page through the use of elements.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example of a paragraph element:</p>
    <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Most elements will have an opening tag and a closing tag. Sometimes, those tags are referred to as start and end tags. In between these two tags, you'll have the content, which can be text or other HTML elements. Both opening and closing tags start with a left angle bracket(<code>&lt;</code>) and end with a right angle bracket(<code>&gt;</code>), with the tag name placed between these angle brackets. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a closer look at just the opening and closing paragraph tags. 
    </p> 
    <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    <br>
    <br>  
    <p>
        What distinguishes an opening tag from a closing tag is the forward slash placed immediately after the left angle bracket in a closing tag.
    </p>  
    <p>
        Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These are known as void elements. Here's an example of an <code>img</code> element, which is a void element. 
    </p>     
    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
    <br>
    <br>    
    <p>    
        Notice that this <code>img</code> element does not have a closing tag and it does not have any content. Void elements cannot have any content and only have a start tag. If you want to display an image, you'll need to include a couple of attributes inside your <code>img</code> element. An attribute is a special value used to adjust the behavior of an HTML element. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's an example of an <code>img</code> element with a <code>src</code> or Source attribute. 
    </p>
    <code>&lt;img src="img-location-goes-here"&gt;</code>
    <br>
    <br>     
    <p>     
        The <code>src</code> attribute is used to specify the location for that image. For <code>img</code> elements, it's good practice to include another attribute called the <code>alt</code> attribute. 
    </p>    
    <p>     
        Here's an example of an <code>img</code> element with the <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> attributes.    
    </p>  
    <code>&lt;img src="example-cat-img-url" alt="Cat sleeping in the grass"&gt;</code>
    <br>
    <br>    
    <p>     
        The <code>alt</code> attribute is used to provide short descriptive text for the images. In this case, the descriptive text is "a cat sleeping in the grass."
    </p>
    <p>
        So you might be wondering if HTML by itself is enough to build a website. Well, the answer is it depends. If you're building a small practice project that only displays text and images, HTML alone might be sufficient. However, if you're creating a modern professional website, you'll need to have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is for the content and structure, CSS is for the styling, and JavaScript is for adding interactivity to your web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good analogy for this is to compare HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a complete building.
    </p>    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> represents the blocks, concrete, and iron that make up the walls. It's the foundation that makes the building strong.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> represents the interior and exterior design that makes the house look beautiful.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> represents the electrical and water system that ensures uninterrupted access to water and electricity.</li>
    </ul>
