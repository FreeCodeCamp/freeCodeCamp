Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

## Working with the Number Data Type

- **Definition**: JavaScript's `Number` type includes integers, floating-point numbers `Infinity` and `NaN`. Floating-point numbers are numbers with a decimal point. Positive `Infinity` is a number greater than any other number while `-Infinity` is a number smaller than any other number. `NaN` (`Not a Number`) which represents an invalid numeric value like the string `"Jessica"`.

## Common Arithmetic Operations  

- **Addition Operator**: This operator (`+`) is used to calculate the sum of one or more numbers. 
- **Subtraction Operator**: This operator (`-`) is used to calculate the difference between two numbers.
- **Multiplication Operator**: This operator (`*`) is used to calculate the product of one or more numbers. 
- **Division Operator**: This operator (`/`) is used to calculate the quotient between two numbers
- **Division By Zero**: If you try to divide by zero, JavaScript will return `Infinity`.
- **Remainder Operator**: This operator(`%`) returns the remainder of a division. 
- **Exponentiation Operator**: This operator (`**`) raises one number to the power of another.

## Calculations with Numbers and Strings 

- **Explanation**: When you use the `+` operator with a number and a string, JavaScript will coerce the number into a string and concatenate the two values.  When you use the `-`, `*` or `/` operators with a string and number, JavaScript will coerce the string into a number and the result will be a number. For `null` and `undefined`, JavaScript treats `null` as 0 and undefined as `NaN` in mathematical operations.

```js
const result = 5 + '10';

console.log(result); // 510
console.log(typeof result); // string

const subtractionResult = '10' - 5;
console.log(subtractionResult); // 5
console.log(typeof subtractionResult); // number

const multiplicationResult = '10' * 2;
console.log(multiplicationResult); // 20
console.log(typeof multiplicationResult); // number

const divisionResult = '20' / 2;
console.log(divisionResult); // 10
console.log(typeof divisionResult); // number

const result1 = null + 5;
console.log(result1); // 5
console.log(typeof result1); // number

const result2 = undefined + 5;
console.log(result2); // NaN
console.log(typeof result2); // number
```

## Operator Precedence 

- **Definition**: Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. Values inside the parenthesis will be evaluated first and multiplication/division will have higher precedence then addition/subtraction. If the operators have the same precedence, then JavaScript will use associativity. Associativity is what tells JavaScript whether to evaluate operators from left to right or right to left. For example, the exponent operator is also right to left associative:

```js
const result = (2 + 3) * 4;

console.log(result); // 20

const result2 = 10 - 2 + 3;

console.log(result2); // 11

const result3 = 2 ** 3 ** 2;

console.log(result3); // 512
```

## Increment and Decrement Operators

- **Increment Operator**: This operator is used to increase the value by one. The prefix notation `++x` increases the value of the variable first, then returns a new value. The postfix notation `x++` returns the current value of the variable first, then increases it.

```js
let x = 5;

console.log(++x); // 6
console.log(x); // 6


let y = 5;

console.log(y++); // 5
console.log(y); // 6
```

- **Decrement Operator**: This operator is used to decrease the value by one. 

## Compound Assignment Operators

- **Addition Assignment (`+=`) Operator**: This operator performs addition on the values and assigns the result to the variable.
- **Subtraction Assignment (`-=`) Operator**: This operator performs subtraction on the values and assigns the result to the variable.
- **Multiplication Assignment (`*=`) Operator**: This operator performs multiplication on the values and assigns the result to the variable.
- **Division Assignment (`/=`) Operator**: This operator performs division on the values and assigns the result to the variable.
- **Remainder Assignment (`%=`) Operator**: This operator divides a variable by the specified number and assigns the remainder to the variable.
- **Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`) Operator**: This operator raises a variable to the power of the specified number and reassigns the result to the variable.
- **`Bitwise AND` Assignment (`&=`) Operator**: This operator performs a `bitwise AND` operation with the specified number and reassigns the result to the variable.
- **`Bitwise OR` Assignment (`|=`) Operator**: This operator performs a `bitwise OR` operation with the specified number and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Booleans and Equality 

- **Boolean Definition**: A boolean is a data type that can only have two values: `true` or `false`. 
- **Equality (`==`) Operator**: This operator uses type coercion before checking if the values are equal.

```js
console.log(5 == '5'); // true
```

- **Strict Equality (`===`) Operator**: This operator does not perform type coercion and checks if both the types and values are equal.

```js
console.log(5 === '5'); // false
```

- **Inequality (`!=`) Operator**: This operator uses type coercion before checking if the values are not equal.
- **Strict  Inequality (`!==`) Operator**: This operator does not perform type coercion and checks if both the types and values are not equal.

## Comparison Operators  

- **Greater Than (`>`) Operator**: This operator checks if the value on the left is greater than the one on the right.
- **Greater Than (`>=`) or Equal Operator**: This operator checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the one on the right.
- **Less Than (`<`) Operator**: This operator checks if the value on the left is less than the one on the right.
- **Less Than (`<=`) or Equal Operator**: This operator checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the one on the right.

## Unary Operators  

- **Unary Plus Operator**: This operator converts its operand into a number. If the operand is already a number, it remains unchanged.

```js
const str = '42';
const num = +str;

console.log(num); // 42
console.log(typeof num); // number
```

- **Unary Negation Operator**: This operator negates the operand.
- **`logical NOT` (`!`) Operator**: This operator flips the boolean value of its operand. So, if the operand is `true`, it becomes `false`, and if it’s `false`, it becomes `true`. 
- **`bitwise NOT` (`~`) Operator**: This operator inverts the binary representation of a number.
