## --text--

Which of the following operators should you use to subtract one number from another?

## --distractors--

`+`

### --feedback--

Think about the symbol typically used for subtraction.

---

`*`

### --feedback--

## --answer--

`-`

## --text--

What’s the output of the following code?

```js
const result = 4 / 0;
console.log(result);
```

## --distractors--

`4`

### --feedback--

Recall the special value JavaScript returns when you divide by zero.

---

`1`

### --feedback--

Recall the special value JavaScript returns when you divide by zero.

---

`16`

### --feedback--

Recall the special value JavaScript returns when you divide by zero.

## --answer--

`Infinity`

## --text--

What’s the output of the following code?

```js
const remainder = 5 % 3;
console.log(remainder);
```

## --distractors--

`15`

### --feedback--

Remember that `%` is the remainder operator, so another way to think of the equation is, after `3` goes into `5` once, what’s left?

---

`3`

### --feedback--

Remember that `%` is the remainder operator, so another way to think of the equation is, after `3` goes into `5` once, what’s left?
