# --questions--

## --text--

How does operator precedence in JavaScript compare to mathematics?

## --distractors--

Addition happens before multiplication and division.

### --feedback--

Think about the order of operations you follow in math equations.

---

All operations are performed in the order they appear.

### --feedback--

Think about the order of operations you follow in math equations.

---

Subtraction takes precedence over all other operations.

### --feedback--

Think about the order of operations you follow in math equations.

## --answer--

Division and multiplication happen before addition and subtraction, just like in mathematics.

## --text--

How can you override operator precedence in JavaScript?

## --distractors--

By using the addition operator (`+`) to change the order of operations.

### --feedback--

Think about how you change the order of operations in math equations.

---

By reversing the operators in the expression.

### --feedback--

Think about how you change the order of operations in math equations.

---

By performing all operations left to right, regardless of precedence.

### --feedback--

Think about how you change the order of operations in math equations.

## --answer--

By using parentheses to force certain parts of the expression to be evaluated first.

## --text--

How does JavaScript evaluate expressions with the exponent operator (`**`)?

## --distractors--

From left to right.

### --feedback--

Think about the order in which exponentiation occurs in the expression.

---

By multiplying the base by itself the number of times indicated.

### --feedback--

Think about the order in which exponentiation occurs in the expression.

---

By adding the exponents together first, then calculating the result.

### --feedback--

Think about the order in which exponentiation occurs in the expression.

## --answer--

From right to left, meaning it evaluates the rightmost exponentiation first.
