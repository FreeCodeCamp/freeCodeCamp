# --description--

In this workshop, you'll biuld a plant nursery catalog while practicing with JavaScript's Map and Set objects.

To represent each plant in your catalog, you'll use objects, each with three properties:

- `commonName`, the common name of the plant
- `scientificName`, the scientific name, or latin name
- `cultivar`, the variety of the plant

Start by creating an object to represent the `Spanish Lavender` (scientific name `Lavandula stoechas`) of a cultivar called `Ballerina` and assign it to a variable named `ballerina`.
