Watch the lecture video and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What will be the output of the following code?

```js
let str = "  HELLO world  ";
let result = str.trim().toLowerCase().split(' ');
console.log(result);
```

## --distractors--

`["HELLO", "world"]`

### --feedback--

Consider the effect of each method in the chain: `trim()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `split()`.

---

`"hello world"`

### --feedback--

Consider the effect of each method in the chain: `trim()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `split()`.

---

`[" HELLO", "world "]`

### --feedback--

Consider the effect of each method in the chain: `trim()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `split()`.

## --answer--

`["hello", "world"]`

## --text--

In the context of method chaining, what should a method typically return to allow further chaining?

## --distractors--

`undefined`

### --feedback--

Think about what allows the next method in the chain to be called immediately after the current one.

---

`null`

### --feedback--

Think about what allows the next method in the chain to be called immediately after the current one.

---

A new object.

### --feedback--

Think about what allows the next method in the chain to be called immediately after the current one.

## --answer--

The object itself (`this`).

## --text--

What will be the result of the following code?

```js
let obj = {
    value: 1,
    increment: function() {
        this.value++;
        return this;
    },
    double: function() {
        this.value *= 2;
        return this;
    },
    getValue: function() {
        return this.value;
    }
};

let result = obj.increment().double().increment().getValue();
console.log(result);
```

## --distractors--

`2`

### --feedback--

Follow the chain of method calls and their effects on the `value` property.

---

`3`

### --feedback--

Follow the chain of method calls and their effects on the `value` property.

---

`4`

### --feedback--

Follow the chain of method calls and their effects on the `value` property.

## --answer--

`5`
