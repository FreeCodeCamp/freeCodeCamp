# --description--

Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

## Working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

While HTML and CSS provide website structure, JavaScript brings interactivity to websites by enabling complex functionality, such as handling user input, animating elements, and even building full web applications.

## Datatypes in JavaScript

Data types help the program understand the kind of data itâ€™s working with, whether it's a number, text, or something else.

### Number Data Type

A number represents both integers and floating-point values. Examples of integers include 7, 19, and 90. 

### Floating point Data Type

A floating point number is a number with a decimal point. Examples include 3.14, 0.5, and 0.0001.

### String Data Type

A string is a sequence of characters, or text, enclosed in quotes. `"I like coding"` and `'JavaScript is fun'` are examples of strings.

### Boolean Data Type
A boolean represents one of two possible values: `true` or `false`. You can use a boolean to represent a condition, such as `isLoggedin = true`.

### Undefined and Null Data Type

An undefined value is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. 

A null value is an empty value, or a variable that has intentionally been assigned a value of `null`.

### Object Data Type

An object is a collection of key-value pairs. The key is the property name, and the value is the property value.

Here, the `pet` object has three properties or keys: `name`, `age`, and `type`. The values are `Fluffy`, `3`, and `dog`, respectively.

```js
let pet = {
  name: 'Fluffy',
  age: 3,
  type: 'dog'
};
```

### Symbol Data Type

The Symbol data type is a unique and immutable value that may be used as an identifier for object properties.

In this example below, two symbols are created with the same description, but they are not equal.

```js
const crytpicKey1= Symbol('saltNpepper');
const crytpicKey2= Symbol('saltNpepper');
console.log(crytpicKey1 === crytpicKey2); // false
```

### BigInt Data Type

When the number is too large for the `Number` data type, you can use the BigInt data type to represent integers of arbitrary length.

By adding an `n` to the end of the number, you can create a BigInt.

```js
const veryBigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

## Variables in JavaScript

In JavaScript, variables act as containers for storing data that you can access and modify throughout your program. 

One way to declare a variable in JavaScript, is to use the `let` keyword. 

```js
let cityName;
```

To assign a value to a variable, you can use the assignment operator `=`.

```js
cityName = 'New York';
```

Variables declared using `let` can be reassigned a new value.

```js
cityName = 'Los Angeles';
console.log(cityName); // Los Angeles
```

Apart from `let`, you can also use `const` to declare a variable. However, a `const` variable cannot be reassigned a new value.

```js
const cityName = 'New York';
cityName = 'Los Angeles'; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

Variables declared using `const` find uses in declaring constants, that are not allowed to change through out the code, such as `PI` or `MAX_SIZE`.

### Variable naming conventions

While naming variables seem simple, it's important to follow best practices to make your code more readable and maintainable.

- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.
- Variable names should be camelCase like `cityName`, `isLoggedin`, and `veryBigNumber`.
- Variable names should not start with a number. They must begin with a letter, `_`, or `$`.
- Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters, except for `_` and `$`.
- Variable names should not be reserved keywords.
- Variable names are case-sensitive. `age` and `Age` are different variables.

## Strings and String immutability in JavaScript

Strings are a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. They can be created using single quotes and double quotes.

```js
let correctWay = 'This is a string';
let alsoCorrect = "This is also a string";
```

It should be noted that strings are immutable in JavaScript. This means that once a string is created, you cannot change the characters in the string.

However, you can still reassign strings to a new value.

```js
let firstName = 'John';
firstName = 'Jane'; // Reassigning the string to a new value
```

## String concatenation in JavaScript

Concatenation is the process of joining multiple strings or combining strings with variables that hold text.
The + operator is one of the simplest and most frequently used methods to concatenate strings. 

```js
let studentName = 'Asad';
let studentAge = 25;
let studentInfo = studentName + ' is ' + studentAge + ' years old.';
console.log(studentInfo); // Asad is 25 years old.
```

If you need to add or append to an existing string, then you can use the  += operator. This is helpful when you want to build upon a string by adding more text to it over time.

```js
let message = 'Welcome to programming, ';
message += 'Asad!';
console.log(message); // Welcome to programming, Asad!
```

Another way you can concatenate strings is to use the concat method. This method joins two or more strings together.

```js
let firstName = 'John';
let lastName = 'Doe';
let fullName = firstName.concat(' ', lastName);
console.log(fullName); // John Doe
```
