## JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks

- JavaScript libraries and frameworks offer quick solutions to common problems and speed up development by providing pre-built code.
- Libraries are generally more focused on providing solutions to specific tasks, such as manipulating the DOM, handling events, or managing AJAX requests. 
- An example of a JavaScript library is jQuery.
- Frameworks, on the other hand, provide a more defined structure for building applications. They often come with a set of rules and conventions that developers need to follow.
- Examples of frameworks include Angular and React.
- **Single page applications**(SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the application without reloading the entire page.
- SPAs use JavaScript to manage the application's state and render content. This is often done using frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, which provide great tools for building complex user interfaces.
- Some issues surrounding SPAs include:

  - Screenreaders struggle struggle with dynamicaaly updated content.
  - The URL does not change when the user navigates within the application, which can make it difficult to bookmark, backtrack or share specific pages.
  - Initial load time can be slow if the application is large as all the assets need to be loaded upfront.

## React- a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

- React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces and web applications.
- A core concept of React is creation of reusable UI components that can update and render independently as data changes.
- React allows developers to describe how the UI should look like based on the application state. React then updates and renders the right components when the data or the state changes.

## React Components

- Components are the building blocks of React applications that allow developers to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, manageable pieces.
- The UI is described using JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
- Components are basically JS functions or classes that return a piece of UI. 
Here is an example of a simple React component that renders a greeting message:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
    const name = 'Anna';
    return <h1>Welcome, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

To use the component, you can simply call:
    
```jsx
    <Greeting />
```

## Meta frameworks

- Meta frameworks, also known as full-stack frameworks, are tools that are build upon existing libraries or frameworks to provide additional features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), routing, code splitting, and optimized build processes out of the box.
- In the React ecosystem, Next.js is an example of a meta framework.

Here is an example of a simple Next.js page that renders the same greeting message as the previous example:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
    const name = 'Anna';
    return <h1>Welcome, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting
```

- Meta frameworks can perform server-side rendering. This means that the initial HTML is rendered on the server, which can lead to faster page loads and improved SEO.

## CLI tools for project setup

- Project setup tools and CLIs provide a quick & easy way to start new projects, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with configuration. 
- Vite, a popular project setup tool, can be used with React, Vue, Svelte, and even vanilla JavaScript projects.
- To create a new project with Vite, you can use the following command in your terminal:
    
```bash
npm init vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

This command creates a new React project named `my-react-app` using Vite's React template. 

- Vite also provides a dev server to see the changes live on the browser.
- Create React App (CRA), another widely used tool, is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. To create a new project with CRA, you would use:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

- For Vue.js projects, the Vue CLI is a popular choice. You can start a new Vue project by running:

```bash
npm init vue@latest
```

This command will prompt you with questions about your project setup, allowing you to choose features like TypeScript support, routing, and state management.

- Angular projects can be set up using the Angular CLI. To create a new Angular project, you can run:

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
```

- The Angular CLI will ask you some questions to customize your project setup, such as if you want to include routing and which CSS preprocessor you would like to use.

## Dependency management in React

- Dependency management refers to the process of handling external code packages that your project relies on. These packages, also known as dependencies, can range from small utility functions to large libraries like React JS.
- Dependency management is typically handled by package managers. The most popular package managers are npm (Node Package Manager), Yarn, and more recently, pnpm.
- When you create a new React project using Create React App, npm is used to install the necessary dependencies. You can add new dependencies to your project using `npm install <package-name>`. This will download the package and add it to your project's `package.json` file.
- The `package.json` file contains a list of all the dependencies and devDependencies used in your project, along with their versions. This file is used to track and manage the dependencies of your project.

Here is an example of a package.json file:

```json
{
    "name": "my-react-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "react": "^17.0.2",
        "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "babel": "^7.15.0",
        "webpack": "^5.51.1"
    }
}
```

Dependency management also involves keeping your packages up-to-date. You can check for updates using commands like `npm outdated` and update packages using `npm update`. It's important to be cautious when updating dependencies, especially for major version changes, as these can most of the time break your codebase.

Here are some npm commands that are commonly used for dependency management:

- `npm install`: installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
- `npm install <package-name>`: installs a specific package and adds it to the package.json file.
- `npm update`: updates all the dependencies to their latest versions.

## Passing props in React components

- In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This mechanism is needed to create reusable and dynamic UI elements.
- Props can be of these types: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or arrays. To pass props from a parent to a child component, you add the props as attributes when you use the child component in the parent's JSX. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
// Parent component
function Parent() {
    const name = 'Anna';
    return <Child name={name} />;
}

// Child component
function Child(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

You can pass multiple props using the spread operator `(...)`, after converting them to an object. Hereâ€™s an example:
    
```jsx
// Parent component
function Parent() {
    const person = {
        name: 'Anna',
        age: 25,
        city: 'New York'
    };
    return <Child {...person} />;
}
```

In this code, the spread operator `{...person}` converts the person object into individual props that are passed to the Child component.

## Conditional rendering in React

- Conditional rendering in React allows you to create dynamic user interfaces. It is used to show different content based on certain conditions or states within your application.
- There are several ways to conditionally render content in React. One common approach is to use the ternary operator. Here's an example:

```jsx
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
    return (
        <div>
            {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please log in</h1>}
        </div>
    );
}
```

- Another way to conditionally render content is to use the logical AND(`&&`) operator. This is useful when you want to render content only if a certain condition is met. Here's an example:

```jsx
function Greeting({ user }) {
    return (
        <div>
            {user && <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>}
        </div>
    );
}
```

In the code above, the `h1` element is only rendered if the user object is truthy.

## Rendering lists in React

- Rendering lists in React is a common task when building user interfaces. 
- Lists can be rendered using the JS array `map()` method to iterate over an array of items and return a new array of JSX elements.
- For example, if you have an array of names that you want to render as a list, you can do the following:

```jsx
function NameList({ names }) {
    return (
        <ul>
            {names.map((name, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{name}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
}
```

- Always remember to provide a unique key for each list item to help React manage the updating and rendering roles. With these techniques, you can create flexible, efficient, and dynamic lists in your React applications.

## Inline styles in React

- Inline styles in React allow you to apply CSS styles directly to JSX elements using JavaScript objects.
- To apply inline styles in React, you can use the style attribute on JSX elements. The style attribute takes an object where the keys are CSS properties in camelCase and the values are the corresponding values. Here's an example:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
    const styles = {
        color: 'blue',
        fontSize: '24px',
        backgroundColor: 'lightgray'
    };

    return <h1 style={styles}>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

- Inline styles support dynamic styling by allowing you to conditionally apply styles based on props or state. Here is an example of how you can conditionally apply styles based on a prop:

```jsx
function Greeting({ isImportant }) {
    const styles = {
        color: isImportant ? 'red' : 'black',
        fontSize: isImportant ? '24px' : '16px'
    };

    return <h1 style={styles}>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

- In the code above, the `color` and `fontSize` styles are conditionally set based on the `isImportant` prop.
