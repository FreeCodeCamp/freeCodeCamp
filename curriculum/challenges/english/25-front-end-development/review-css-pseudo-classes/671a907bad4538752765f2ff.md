## Pseudo-classes

- **Pseudo-classes Definition**: These are special CSS keywords that allow you to select an element based on its specific state or position.
- **User Action Pseudo-classes**: These are special keywords that allow you to change the appearance of elements based on user interactions, improving the overall user experience.
- **Input Pseudo-classes**: These pseudo-classes are used to target HTML `input` elements based on the state they are in before and after user interaction.
- **Location Pseudo-classes**: These pseudo-classes are used for styling links and elements that are targeted within the current document.
- **Tree-structural Pseudo-classes**: These pseudo-classes allow you to target and style elements based on their position within the document tree. 
- **Functional Pseudo-classes**: Functional pseudo-classes allow you to select elements based on more complex conditions or relationships. Unlike regular pseudo-classes which target elements based on a state (for example, :hover, :focus), functional pseudo-classes accept arguments.
- **`:active` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class lets you select the active state of an element, like clicking on a button.
- **`:visited` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class targets a link the user has visited. 
- **`:hover` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class defines the hover state of an element.
- **`:visited` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class lets you style a link the user has already visited:
- **`:disabled` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class lets you style an interactive element in disabled mode.
- **`:focus` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class applies styles when an element gains focus, typically through keyboard navigation or when a user clicks into a form input.
- **`:checked` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is used to indicate to the user that it is checked.
- **`:focus-within` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is used to apply styles to an element when it or any of its descendants have focus.
- **`:enabled` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is used to target form buttons or other elements that are currently enabled.
- **`:target` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is used to apply styles to an element that is the target of a URL fragment 
- **`:required` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class targets `input` elements that have the `required` attribute. It signals to the user that they must fill out the field to submit the form.
- **`:valid` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class targets the input fields that meet the validation criteria.
- **`:invalid` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class targets the input fields that do not meet the validation criteria.
- **`:autofill` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class applies styles to input fields that the browser automatically fills with saved data.
- **`:optional` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class applies styles input elements that are not required and can be left empty.
- **`:in-range` and `:out-of-range` Pseudo-classes**: These pseudo-classes applies styles to elements based on whether their values are within or outside specified range constraints.
- **`:link` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class allows you to target all unvisited links on a webpage. You can use it to style links differently before the user clicks on them.
- **`:any-link` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class is a combination of the :link and :visited pseudo-classes. So, it matches any anchor element with an href attribute, regardless of whether it’s visited or not.
- **`:local-link` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class targets links that point to the same document. It can be useful when you want to differentiate internal links from external ones.
- **`:root` Pseudo-class**: ​​This pseudo-class is usually the root `<html>` element. It helps you target the highest level in the document so you can apply a common style to the entire document.        
- **`:empty` Pseudo-class**: Empty elements, that is, elements with no children other than white space, are also included in the document tree. That's why there's an `:empty` pseudo-class to target empty elements.
- **`:nth-child(n)` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class allows you to select elements based on their position within a parent.
- **`:nth-last-child(n)` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class enables you to select elements by counting from the end.
- **`:first-child` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the first element in a parent element or the document.
- **`:last-child` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the last element in a parent element or the document
- **`:only-child` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the only element in a parent element or the document
- **`:first-of-type` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the first occurrence of a specific element type within its parent.
- **`:last-of-type` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects the last occurrence of a specific element type within its parent.
- **`:nth-of-type(n)` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class allows you to select a specific element within its parent based on its position among siblings of the same type.
- **`:only-of-type` Pseudo-class**: This pseudo-class selects an element if it’s the only one of its type within its parent.
