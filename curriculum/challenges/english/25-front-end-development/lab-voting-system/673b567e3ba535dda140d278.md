# --description--

In this lab, you will build a voting system that would use `Map` to create a poll and `Set` to prevent duplicate voting.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. 

**User Stories:**

1. You should initialize the `poll` variable to a new `Map` object.

2. You should have a function `addOption` that accepts a parameter `option`.

3. In the `addOption` function:

   - If the `option` does not already exist in the poll, it should be added to the poll with an empty `Set` as its value to track voters. You should also return the message `Option "<option>" added to the poll.`

   - If the `option` already exists, it should return the message `Option "<option>" already exists.`.

4. You should have a function `vote` that accepts two parameters, `option`(the option to vote for) and `voterId` (a unique ID for the voter).

5. In the `vote` function:

   - If the `option` does not exist in the poll, the function should return the message `Option "<option>" does not exist.`;

   - If the `option` exists, the function should check if the `voterId` has already voted for this `option`.

   - If the voter has already voted, the function should display the message `Voter <voterId> has already voted for "<option>".`

   - If the voter has not voted, `voterId` should be added to the `Set` of `voters` for this option. The function should return the message  `Voter <voterId> voted for "<option>".`

6. You should have a function `displayResults` that returns the poll results in the following format:

```js
Poll Results:
Option A: N votes
Option B: N votes
.
.
```

## --seed-contents--

You should have a `poll` variable initialized to a new `Map` object.

```js

```

You should define a function `addOption` that accepts a parameter `option`.

```js

```

You should define a function `vote` that accepts two parameters, `option` and `voterId`.

```js

```

You should define a function `displayResults` to display the poll results.

```js

```

`addOption("Turkey")` should return `Option "Turkey" added to the poll.`

```js

```

Adding an empty option should return `"Option cannot be empty."`

```js

```

when "Turkey" is already added, `addOption("Turkey")` should return `Option "Turkey" already exists.`

```js

```

When `Turkey` exists in the voting options, `vote("Turkey", "traveler1")` should return `Voter traveler1 voted for "Turkey".`

```js

```

when `traveler1` tries to vote for `Turkey` again, `vote("Turkey", "traveler1")` should return `Voter traveler1 has already voted for "Turkey".`

```js

```

When `Morocco` is not in the voting options, `vote("Morocco", "traveler2")` should return `Option "Morocco" does not exist.`

```js

```

A unique option should be able to receive multiple votes. `vote("Turkey", "traveler2")` should return `Voter traveler2 voted for "Turkey".`

```js

```

`displayResults()` should return the results in the correct format.

```js

```


# --solutions--

```js
const poll = new Map();

function addOption(option) {
  if (!option || option.trim() === "") {
    return "Option cannot be empty.";
  }
  if (!poll.has(option)) {
    poll.set(option, new Set());
    return `Option "${option}" added to the poll.`;
  } else {
    return `Option "${option}" already exists.`;
  }
}


function vote(option, voterId) {
  if (!poll.has(option)) {
    return `Option "${option}" does not exist.`;
  }
  const voters = poll.get(option);
  if (voters.has(voterId)) {
    return `Voter ${voterId} has already voted for "${option}".`;
  } else {
    voters.add(voterId); 
    return `Voter ${voterId} voted for "${option}".`;
  }
}

function displayResults() {
    let results = "Poll Results:\n";
    for (let [option, voters] of poll.entries()) {
        results += `${option}: ${voters.size} votes\n`;
    }
    return results.trim();
}
```
