# --description--

You will be working on this project with our Gitpod starter code.

We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the Python curriculum. For now, here are some videos on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know to complete this project:

# --instructions--

Create a web vulnerability scanner using Python. The scanner should identify common web security issues in a safe and ethical manner. In the `vulnerability_scanner.py` file, create a class called `WebScanner` that performs security checks on web applications.

The scanner should:

1. Check for common web vulnerabilities:
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
   - SQL Injection points
   - Insecure HTTP headers
   - Directory traversal vulnerabilities
   - Open ports and services
   
2. Generate detailed reports including:
   - Vulnerability type and severity
   - Location of the vulnerability
   - Suggested fixes
   - References to security best practices

3. Include safety features:
   - Rate limiting to prevent DoS
   - Respect robots.txt
   - Option to exclude sensitive endpoints
   - Ethical scanning guidelines

Here's how the scanner should be used:

```python
scanner = WebScanner("https://example.com")

# Basic scan
results = scanner.scan()

# Targeted scan for specific vulnerabilities
xss_results = scanner.scan_xss()
sqli_results = scanner.scan_sql_injection()
header_results = scanner.check_security_headers()

# Generate report
report = scanner.generate_report()
```

The scan results should be returned in this format:

```python
{
    "target": "https://example.com",
    "scan_time": "2023-12-20 10:30:45",
    "vulnerabilities": [
        {
            "type": "XSS",
            "severity": "High",
            "location": "/search?q=",
            "description": "Reflected XSS vulnerability found",
            "proof": "<script>alert(1)</script>",
            "fix": "Implement proper input sanitization",
            "references": ["OWASP XSS Prevention"]
        }
    ],
    "security_headers": {
        "X-Frame-Options": "Missing",
        "X-XSS-Protection": "Present",
        "Content-Security-Policy": "Missing"
    },
    "summary": {
        "high_severity": 2,
        "medium_severity": 3,
        "low_severity": 1
    }
}
```

The scanner should include these optional parameters:

- `depth` (int): Maximum crawl depth
- `timeout` (int): Request timeout in seconds
- `exclude_paths` (list): URLs to skip
- `custom_payloads` (dict): Custom test payloads
- `verify_ssl` (bool): Whether to verify SSL certificates

Example verbose output:

```bash
Web Vulnerability Scan Report for example.com
===========================================

CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES:
------------------------
[HIGH] XSS Vulnerability
Location: /search?q=
Payload: <script>alert(1)</script>
Fix: Implement input sanitization and CSP headers

[HIGH] SQL Injection
Location: /users?id=
Payload: 1' OR '1'='1
Fix: Use parameterized queries

SECURITY HEADERS:
---------------
 X-Frame-Options: DENY
✗ Content-Security-Policy: Missing
✓ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

SUMMARY:
--------
Critical: 2
High: 3
Medium: 1
Low: 2
```

Important security considerations:

1. Only scan websites you have permission to test
2. Include rate limiting and respect robots.txt
3. Don't perform destructive tests
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Don't store sensitive information

The scanner should use these best practices:

- Asynchronous requests for better performance
- Modular design for easy extension
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear documentation
- Test coverage for core functionality

# --hints--

It should pass all Python tests.

```js

```

# --solutions--

```py
  # Python challenges don't need solutions,
  # because they would need to be tested against a full working project.
