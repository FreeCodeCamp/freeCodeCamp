## --blanks--

---

`won't`

### --feedback--

This is the contraction for `will not`.

# --explanation--

The `First Conditional` is used to talk about possible situations in the present or future. It is formed with `if` + `Present Simple` (for the condition) and `will` + base verb (for the result). For example:

`If you forget to save your work, you will lose your progress.` - Not saving will cause you to lose what you've done.

In this dialogue, `If the power cable isn't connected securely` is the condition, and `the computer won't turn on` is the result of that condition not being met.
