`Real-world feedback` refers to feedback from actual users in practical, everyday situations, outside of controlled testing environments. For example:

- `The team gathered real-world feedback to understand how users felt about the app in their daily routines.` - This means that the team wanted feedback from people using the app in real-life conditions to see how well it met their needs.

`Roll it out` means to launch or release a product or service to a wider audience. For example:

- `We will roll out the new feature to all users next month.` - It indicates that the new feature will be released for public use, moving from testing to being available to everyone.
