# --explanation--

- The **present perfect continuous negative** is formed with `hasn't/haven't + been + present participle`, indicating an ongoing action that hasnâ€™t occurred as expected over time. 
  - For example: `He hasn't been exercising regularly.` - This means his exercise routine has been irregular.
  
- The **present perfect negative** uses `hasn't/haven't + past participle`, describing an action that has not been completed up to the present moment. 
  - For example: `He hasn't exercised this week.` - This indicates no exercise occurred this week.
