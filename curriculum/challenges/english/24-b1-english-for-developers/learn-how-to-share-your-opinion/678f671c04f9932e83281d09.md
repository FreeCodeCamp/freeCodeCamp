`Dear Team,`

`I hope you're doing well! We need to choose the best cloud platform for our next project. We’re looking at three options: AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Each platform has its own strengths, but I’m not sure which one is the best choice for us.`

`Well, AWS is very popular, but it could be a bit complex for some of us. Google Cloud might be easier to use, especially for smaller projects. Azure could work well, too, since it fits with the Microsoft tools we already use.`

`I’ve created a poll to gather everyone’s opinion. Please take a moment to vote for the platform you think would be best for our team. The poll will be open for the next few days, and your input will help us make a more informed decision.`

`Thanks for your help!`

`Best,`
`Bob`
