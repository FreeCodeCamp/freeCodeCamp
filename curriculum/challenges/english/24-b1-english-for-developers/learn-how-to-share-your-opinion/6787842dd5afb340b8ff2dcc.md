Let’s break down why the correct answer makes sense:  

`It's easy to learn` – This explains why Python is a good first language. It has simple, beginner-friendly syntax. 

`It has tons of libraries` – This means Python provides many built-in tools that help with different tasks, making it easier to build projects.  

Now, let’s look at the other answer:  

`I've always wanted to be a developer.` – This explains why someone chose to learn programming but not why Python is a good first language.  

The key to answering this question is focusing on what makes Python a good choice, not personal reasons for learning to code.
